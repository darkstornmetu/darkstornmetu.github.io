**Hi, I'm Buğra.**

I am a 32-year-old game developer and have been working at [Twenty Games](https://twenty.games), a mobile game company I co-founded, for the past four years. Before that, I worked as a solo developer for a year and a half. At Twenty Games, we developed hit games that have reached millions of users worldwide, most notably [*Makeup Kit*](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/makeup-kit/id1601985721) and [*Pasta Fever*](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pasta-fever/id1642532274).

I enjoy creating games that feel great to play, with clean, easy-to-read code. While I’m a developer at heart, I’ve specialized in the mobile game development process as a whole—from ideation to post-launch monetization. I actively contribute to ideation and design and have worked as a Lead Designer/Product Owner for about a year. I’ve utilized tools like ClickUp, Notion, and Milanote to streamline the development process and ensure efficient team collaboration. I love spending time on level design and have developed tools to make it easier and more time-efficient. Along the way, I’ve also contributed to designing balanced game economies that enhance player experiences. With an economics background, I’m data-driven and place great importance on data analysis, always keeping key KPIs in mind when making decisions at nearly every stage of development.

I’ve participated in the development of over 100 mobile games, taking on different roles for each one and learning new lessons from every project. Yet, I’m ambitious and believe this is just the tip of the iceberg—the best is yet to come!
