**Hi, I'm Buğra.**

I am a 32-year-old game developer and have been working at [Twenty Games](https://twenty.games), a mobile game company I co-founded, for the past four years. Before that, I worked as a solo developer for one and a half years. At Twenty Games, we developed hit games that have reached millions of users worldwide, most notably [*Makeup Kit*](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/makeup-kit/id1601985721) and [*Pasta Fever*](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pasta-fever/id1642532274).

I enjoy creating games that feel great to play with clean, easy-to-read code. While I am a developer at heart, I have specialized in the mobile game development process as a whole—from ideation to post-launch monetization. I have also prepared game economies to ensure balanced and engaging experiences for players. I actively contribute to the ideation and design process and I have worked as a Lead Designer/Product Owner for about a year. I have utilized tools like ClickUp, Notion and Milanote to streamline the game development process and ensure efficient team collaboration. I love spending time on level design and have developed tools to make it easier and more time-efficient. I am a data-driven person with an economics background. As such, I place great importance on data analysis and always keep key KPIs in mind when making decisions at nearly every stage of the development process.

I have participated in the development of over 100 mobile games, taking on different roles for each one and learning new lessons from every project. Yet, I am ambitious and believe this is just the tip of the iceberg—the best is yet to come!
