        Pasta Fever's game idea came from our game designer when I was working as a product owner. He showed me a video of a real pasta machine and asked if we could gamify it, the decision was instant.<br><br>
        Initial test results were like a dream: 0.20$ CPI, >50% D1 Ret, 40+ min PT. Yet, hyper-casual idle clicker games lacked a key component that generates profit; D7 Retention. We worked hard with Rollic and within ourselves to find solutions to overcome this obstacle; implemented daily missions, daily rewards, new items, new levels, etc. Unfortunately, in the end, Pasta Fever couldn't make a global hit only reaching 500k+ downloads, yet it created a vacuum in hyper-casual scene and made a lot of studios follow its lead.
