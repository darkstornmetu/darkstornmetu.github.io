        I worked on this project back in 2019 when I first started developing games in Unity. Looking back, it was an ambitious project for a beginner, but I learned many things that I otherwise wouldn’t have. I’m glad I started this adventure. Unfortunately, the playable version no longer exists, but I’ll share some images and videos to give you an idea of the game.
