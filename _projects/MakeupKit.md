        When front-stack runners were dominating the market, I had the idea of merging the CPI-friendly beauty concept with retention-proven front-stack runners. With that perspective, using a brush as the main object—which is highly customizable in terms of color and appearance and provides the "feeling" of hair animation—seemed a perfect fit. During the ideation stage, secondary makeup items and upgrade doors came into the picture, and we were ready to go!

        The initial Facebook CPI values weren't all that impressive; however, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CaPktK-DMWS/" target="_blank">fail gameplay videos</a> of the game were viewed by over 6 million people in just two days. Therefore, from the very start, we expected something big. In the end, Makeup Kit reached the top of the charts, attracting nearly 10 million users worldwide.
