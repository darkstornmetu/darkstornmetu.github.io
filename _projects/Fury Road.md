        Fury Road! was the first game we made with hit potential. On the very first day of development, I set up a desert terrain, added a cloudy skybox, and some fog, and boom! I was immediately excited. As the development process continued, all of us started to feel the excitement. I remember staying up all night during testing, watching the CPI values drop as I refreshed the screen. When we saw the $0.11 CPI, we didn’t hesitate to update the game further. However, the playtime and retention were not promising, and even after several updates, we couldn’t make it work. In the end, it was a bit of a disappointment for us, but we learned that failures are part of success, and we kept going.
